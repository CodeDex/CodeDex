IDEA #1:

MetaModelFetchers are the main carriers, they fetch the data from their input and build a MetaModel from it.

PROBLEM #1:

Multiple MetaModelFetchers for a backup system if a fetcher can't deliver a certain value are not self-explanatory

    SOLUTION #1a:

    Multiple MetaModelFetchers don't exist as a team (Bad Solution)

    SOLUTION #1b:

    Prioritized MetaModelFetcher teams by providing a MetaModelBuilder class which uses a MetaModelFetcher priority list / queue as a parameter.

DESCRIPTION #1b:

MetaModels are only containers for the information. They are supposed to be immutable once created.
MetaModelFetchers have the functionality of using input to fetch necessary information for the MetaModels.
MetaModelBuilders use the functions of MetaModelFetchers to create new MetaModels.

# CodeDex
Java source code, Javadoc and GitHub project viewer

## Concept
This app is helping improve your performance while coding Android Apps or other Java applications by providing a better understanding for libraries and your own source code.
Our goal is to achieve a visualization of projects that minimizes the time needed to work yourself into a project to get started on it, or to simply understand it.
